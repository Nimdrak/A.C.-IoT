Distributed MIP Logging
</H2>

<P>
Logging for distributed MIP is very similar to the standard MIP logging.  The main
differences are in the progress section.  The header for the standard MIP logging looks
like this:
<PRE>
    Nodes    |    Current Node    |     Objective Bounds      |     Work
 Expl Unexpl |  Obj  Depth IntInf | Incumbent    BestBd   Gap | It/Node Time
</PRE>
By contrast, the distributed MIP header looks like this:
<PRE>
    Nodes    |    Utilizaiton     |     Objective Bounds      |     Work
 Expl Unexpl |  Active Sync Comm  | Incumbent    BestBd   Gap | It/Node Time
</PRE>
You'll note that columns three through five show different
information.  In the distributed MIP log, these columns give
information about the utilization of the distributed workers,
expressed as percentages.  The first of these columns shows the
fraction of the preceding time period (the time since the previous
progress log line) that the workers spent actively processing MIP
nodes.  The second column shows the time the workers spent waiting for
other workers to complete tasks assigned to them.  The final column
shows the time spent communicating data between machines.  The numbers
sum to 100%.

<P>
Here is an example of a distributed MIP progress log:

<P>
One thing you may find in the progress section is that node counts may
not increase monotonically.  In this example, a solution found at
node 261 is reported before a solution found at node 0.
Distributed MIP tries to create a single, unified view of node
numbers, but with multiple machines processing nodes independently,
possibly at different rates, some inconsistencies are inevitable.

<P>
Another difference is the line that indicates that the distributed
ramp-up phase is complete.  At this point, the distributed strategy
transitions from a concurrent approach to a distributed approach.  The
log line indicates which worker was the <EM>winner</EM> in the
concurrent approach.  Distributed MIP continues by dividing the
partially explored MIP search tree from this worker among all of the
workers.

<P>
Another difference in the distributed log is in the summary section.
The distributed MIP log includes a breakdown of how runtime was spent:
<PRE>
Runtime breakdown:
  Active:  13.73s (75%)
  Sync:     1.16s (6%)
  Comm:     3.45s (19%)
</PRE>
This is an aggregated view of the utilization data that is displayed in the progress
log lines.  In this example, the workers spent 75% of runtime actively working on
MIP nodes, 6% waiting to synchronize with other workers, and 19% communicating
data between machines.
